# Investor_Question_Scraper
This project aims to scrape and collect questions directed at specific companies from investor interaction platforms.

Shanghai Stock Exchange: http://sns.sseinfo.com

This project uses web automation to simulate a human interacting with the website. 
It does so by:
1.Simulating a web browser using Selenium, which automates the Chrome browser to interact with the CNINFO platform. Selenium allows the script to:
  Open the web page.
  Click buttons.
  Enter text into search boxes.
  Navigate through pagination, all mimicking how a user would manually browse the site.
2.Extracting the HTML content of the loaded pages using BeautifulSoup, which is a Python library for parsing HTML and XML documents. Once Selenium loads the page, BeautifulSoup is used to locate and extract specific elements (like questions, stock codes, and reply times) from the page's source code.
